# Research
Although the sample output given by the professor clarifies that there is no need for any graphics, my first thought was Bastet (a terminal game that uses ncurses graphics). Surely is not needed, but I will implement my solution using ncurses.

I recall that using ncurses is a bit complicated for Windows, so I will start by testing a simple ncurses program and making it work on Windows. If the program doesn't work for Windows, I will have to change the strategy. The most important thing is that the professor can open my program in her Windows machine (target user).
